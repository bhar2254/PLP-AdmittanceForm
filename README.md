# SoberShift

SoberShift is an application that I've been working on to help track who is going in/out of a certain orginization.

It's not intended for solely that use. I mostly made this to prove to myself that I still could and will probably be using it as a good stepping stone to jump from Java to C++ and to strengthen my skills.

Let me know what you think if you give it a try.

This project is using QT Jambi which can be found at https://qtjambi.org
